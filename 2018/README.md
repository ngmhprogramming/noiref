# noiref (2018)

Competitions
- NOI Selection Test (55/550)
- Australian Informatics Olympiad (Intermediate) (400/400)

My own noiref.

All code tested and 100% functional.

Feel free to use, but please try to understand as it really helps to understand how the code works.

Fun Fact: I don't understand these:
- Fenwick Tree (Range Update Range Query)
- Longest Increasing Subsequence (n log n)
